Just trying to create a digital version of the book [**_The Warlock of Firetop Mountain_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Warlock_of_Firetop_Mountain) by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone.

At least one game already exists, but it is too different from the core adventure gamebook experience. With this project I want to keep it as faithful as possible to the gaming experience I used to have with my brother as a kid.

Consider buying the original book if you like this!
